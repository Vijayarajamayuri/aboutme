Mayuri Vijaya raja,

I am a new admitted to the Spring 2019 batch and am  pursuing my Masters in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University.

I am from Hyderabad, India. I recently completed my under graduation from JB Institute of engineering and technology . And my hobbies are listening music, dancing. 

My career plan is to work as a software developer. By the time the course gets completed I would like to be familiar with the latest technologies that can help me kick start my career.

I find coding very interesting .I always enjoy doing it and learning new stuff.

Thanks
